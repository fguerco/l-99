# l-99

This is my take on the [99 Lisp problems](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/problemas-lisp/L-99_Ninety-Nine_Lisp_Problems.html)

Files are arranged according to their sections

## Load this system
`> (ql:quickload "l-99")`

## Run tests
After the project is loaded

`> (asdf:test-system "l-99")`
